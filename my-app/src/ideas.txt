Employee Portal Attendence App 
1. Need to implement the Navbar and create custom styling. Maybe can utilize React-Bootstrap for the Navbar decoration but most likely will do custom.
2. First things first though, need to create a db.json file and add fake AA names to ensure it works then dynamically implement it into my app.
3. I will need to create a tab that has a dropdown where I can add a new employee then have a button on the end that has some type of click feature that will add the employee to the list of employees.
4. The new employee list will be based off of a form that you fill out when uploading the new employee
5. form will contain the following structure: 
  1. Date (so you can keep track of the date of the roster creation)
  2. Employee Name ( this should be obvious )
  3. Function ( the role of which the employee is associated )
6. Down the line i'd like to add a duplicate feature where you can duplicate the roster from the previous day to allow for less work when adding the employees in.
7. I'd also like to implement more features catering to the manager on shift to make sure they have all of their labor management tools in once place to avoid headaches.
